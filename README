* Building several models (offline):
Models were designed in Zeppelin notebooks (attached)
They could also be done via scripts submitted from command line, or other notebooks.

note: if you get any "port already in use" messages, look for open ports and kill processes:
> netstat -ntlp
> kill -9 PID


* Create container...
Create environment... 
sudo pip install gunicorn
sudo pip install flask
sudo pip install sklearn
sudo pip install scipy
Install R and jug library

* Deploy models (this is done in python 2.7.5 and R 3.4.3)
MODEL #1:
> gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 server:app

MODEL #2:
> gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5001 server2:app

MODEL #3:
> Rscript jugServer.R

* Call the models via Post (done in Python 3.6.3 & Anaconda)
SCORE:
> python post.py
